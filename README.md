#### Solving CodingChallenges.fyi in `rust-lang`
Intent of solving these questions to get familiar and comfortable in the rust lang.
I'm not trying to solve all the challenges as I'm not much interested in solving
`frontend` related tasks.


There is no proper sequence that I'm following I'm doing it for fun n learning.
This repo doesn't depict my coding competencies n all. Neither these repo are for any
interview preprations. You may not find `README.md` for the projects which is perfectly
fine. As I don't want to spend much time on the documentation part and the thought process.
